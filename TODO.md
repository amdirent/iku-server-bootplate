The New York City medical examiner announced on Friday that a Staten Island man died from a chokehold and the compression of his chest by police officers as they [arrested him last month][chokehold-police-1] for allegedly peddling untaxed cigarettes.\n\nAn autopsy found that the manner of death for Eric Garner, 43, was homicide, the medical examiner said in a statement. While the report found that Mr. Garner\\’s poor health was a contributing factor, it was not the primary cause of his death.\n\nThe New York Police Department [banned the use of a chokehold][chokehold-police-2] more than 20 years ago. The encounter prompted Police Commissioner William J. Bratton to call for a complete review of the Police Department’s training and tactics. It has also presented Mayor Bill de Blasio with a difficult challenge as he tries to balance his support of the police with his campaign promises to reform what he had characterized as over aggressive tactics.\n\nMr. de Blasio released a statement shortly after the autopsy results were revealed, promising a thorough investigation.\n\n“We all have a responsibility to work together to heal the wounds from decades of mistrust and create a culture where the Police Department and the communities they protect respect each other — and that’s a responsibility that Commissioner Bratton and I take very seriously,” the mayor said. “I’ve said that we would make change, and we will.”\n\nThe Staten Island District Attorney’s office said it was still awaiting the full autopsy report and would continue its investigation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also monitoring the case, officials said.\n\nWhen a video of the encounter on July 17 between Mr. Garner and the police [was made public][chokehold-police-2], the reaction was immediate from Mr. Garner’s family and from the thousands of people who watched it online.\n\nCaptured by a bystander on a cellphone, the video shows Mr. Garner arguing with officers, who accused him of selling cigarettes on a Staten Island street corner. Mr. Garner says they are harassing him, then they move to put him into custody. One officer wraps his arm around Mr. Garner’s neck and drags him to the ground. Swarmed by officers, Mr. Garner can be heard saying he cannot breathe. Then he is motionless.\n\nFor more than two decades, the department has had in place a ban on chokeholds, which it defines broadly to include any police maneuver that puts “any pressure to the throat or windpipe, which may prevent or hinder breathing or reduce intake of air.”\n\nIn the video, Mr. Garner can be heard repeating: “I can’t breathe.” Those words have become a rallying cry both for his family and for supporters who see his case as emblematic of more systemic problems in the department and the way it deals with people in minority communities.\n\nMr. Garner was a large man, weighing over 300 pounds, and had other health issues, including diabetes, sleep apnea and asthma. Some of those ailments, as well as obesity and hypertensive cardiovascular disease, were cited in the autopsy as contributing conditions to his death.\n\nBut the statement from the medical examiner’s office was clear in the cause of Mr. Garner’s death, finding that he died from “compression of neck (choke hold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police.”\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Garner’s supporters gave voice to their grievances at a meeting at City Hall with the mayor and the police commissioner.\n\nAt the meeting, the Rev. [Al Sharpton][al-sharpton-chokehold] criticized the police and demanded punishment for the officers who arrested Mr. Garner.\n\n“If Dante wasn’t your son, he’d be a candidate for a chokehold,” Mr. Sharpton said, referring to Mayor de Blasio’s son.\n\nPatrick J. Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, the union that represents rank-and-file officers, said in a statement that had Mr. Garner “not resisted the lawful order of the police officers placing him under arrest, this tragedy would not have occurred.”\n\n[chokehold-police-11]: http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/24/nyregion/kelly-bans-choke-holds-by-officers.html\n[chokehold-police-2]: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/19/nyregion/staten-island-man-dies-after-he-is-put-in-chokehold-during-arrest.html\n[al-sharpton-chokehold]: http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/al_sharpton/index.html?inline=nyt-per
